      <h2>Building a very serious Chrome extension</h2>

      <h4>Lightning Talks</h4>
      <p>
        I recently had to give a lightning talk about a technical topic, I
        decided to do mine on building a chrome extension. It was something I
        knew nothing about, but as a friend of mine has built a popular
        extension I was curious to learn how they worked.
      </p>
      <h4>Well that was easy...</h4>
      <p>
        Before I began any research, I had assumed that building an extension
        was going to be relatively difficult and probably involve languages I
        had no experience with. So I was pleasantly surprised to learn that you
        can make them using just HTML, CSS, &amp; JS.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I began making my own extension to use as an example and a code demo
        for the lightning talk. Beginning with some very complex html...

        <img class="exampleImage" src="/images/honktml.png" />
        <figcaption>Some very challenging code.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>Introducing Honk</h4>
      <p>
        The extension just opens a small html window that says HONK and plays a
        honk noise whenever you click it.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img class="exampleImage" src="/images/honk.png" />
        <figcaption>HONK</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Although this is obviously very simple, I thought the process of doing
        this via a Chrome extension was going to be a lot harder. We were only
        meant to research our topics for 1-2 hours before presenting, so I was
        quite happy to be able to build this as well as put together a
        presentation in that timeframe.
      </p>
      <h4>The future of Honk</h4>
      <p>
        I didn't go through the process of getting this listed in the Chrome
        store, but I do hope to come back to it one day and spice it up a bit to
        the point where I feel happy to publish it (even if it is a joke).
      </p>
      <p>
        I know there's a lot more you can do with extensions like monitoring and
        reacting to user events, accessing the DOM, etc. So I'd really like to
        learn more about how to do those things via an extension and make the
        swan a bit more dynamic.
