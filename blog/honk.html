      <h2>Building a very serious Chrome extension</h2>

      <h4>Lightning Talks</h4>
      <p>
        I recently had to give a lightning talk about a technical topic, I
        decided to do mine on building a chrome extension. It was something I
        knew nothing about, but as a friend of mine has built a popular
        extension I was curious to learn how they worked.
      </p>
      <h4>Well that was easy...</h4>
      <p>
        Before I began any research, I had assumed that building an extension
        was going to be relatively difficult and probably involve languages I
        had no experience with. So I was pleasantly surprised to learn that you
        can make them using just HTML, CSS, &amp; JS.
