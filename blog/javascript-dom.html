        No we're not talking about automating your coffee (except for that one

      <h4>The Three Amigos</h4>
      <p>
        Websites use HTML & CSS to define the content and how it's styled -
        which is all you need if you just want to display some info on a simple
        webpage.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what if you yearn for more? What if you want the page to update
        elements dynamically, to respond to user input, or actually do
        something?
      </p>

      <p>
        That's where JavaScript comes in. With JS you can make your dreams come
        true, buttons now do things, data can now be stored and transformed, the
        web is your oyster.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the web were a superhero, HTML would be their core (morals &
        personality), CSS their costume, and JS their superpower.
      </p>

      <h4>The Spice Must Flow</h4>
      <p class="quote">
        ‚Äú<span
          >Control flow¬†is the order in which the computer executes statements
          in a script.</span
        >‚Äù - MDN
      </p>
      <p>
        Control flow is kind of like a maze: you enter at the start, then may
        encounter different forks in the path and decide which one to go down or
        you might hit a dead end and have to loop back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a look at this diagram showing the ‚Äúcontrol flow‚Äù of making coffee.
        Just like an IF/ELSE statement depending on how tired you are, you might
        make more or less coffee (or shouldn‚Äôt have any at all!). Once you‚Äôre
        finished your first iteration of the coffee making loop, maybe it wasn‚Äôt
        enough and you have to start making more.
      </p>

      <h4>World DOMination</h4>
      <p>
        The DOM is a representation of all of the content of a webpage, handily
        provided in the format of a javascript object. It allows you to access
        and change the content of a page programatically.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can think of the DOM like a tree, parts of the webpage split and
        branch down into different nodes.
      </p>
      <img class="exampleImage" src="/images/domTree.png" />
      <p>
        It‚Äôs important to note that the DOM is a living object (like a tree),
        any changes you make to the DOM will apply to the HTML/CSS and if the
        HTML or CSS is changed, the DOM will reflect that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although it may seem like the DOM is part of javascript, it‚Äôs actually
        provided by the browser along with an API that lets javascript (or any
        programming language) interact with it.
      </p>
      <h4>I Object!</h4>
      <p>
        Arrays and objects are really similar (well technically they‚Äôre
        identical as an array is an object but anyway‚Ä¶), they're both used to
        hold values that you may want to access later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrays hold values in an ordered list and you access a value using its
        index (position) in the array. They begin with 0 and count up from
        there, e.g. to access the first element in an array you would want to
        look for index 0 (array[0]), the second item index 1 (array[1]), etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Objects however, store values with a key üîë. The order of the data
        doesn‚Äôt matter at all! This can be seen when logging an object to the
        console, the order it was written in may be different than how the
        browser returns it.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="/images/objectOrder.png" />
        <figcaption>
          The top item is displayed at the bottom when logged to the console.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        To access a value in an array you simply need to ask for it with the
        key. This can be done with bracket notation like arrays e.g. object[key]
        or you can use dot notation e.g. object.key.
      </p>
      <p>
        Which one should you use? Well that really depends. Bracket notation
        allows for that key value to be an expression, so if you don‚Äôt know
        explicitly what the key will be then you should use brackets.
      </p>

      <h4>Let's Get Func-y</h4>
      <p>
        Functions are essentially re-usable pieces of code that do something.
      </p>
      <p>
        That could be adding numbers together, updating some text somewhere,
        looping through an array, the possibilities are endless! Functions can
        even call other functions, which in turn can call other functions, which
        in turn can call other functions, which... sorry I'll stop now.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="/images/functionExample.png" />
        <figcaption>
          A very helpful function that will do things for you.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        One of the core principles of clean code is DRY - don‚Äôt repeat yourself
        (ignore the previous sentence).
      </p>
      <p>
        Functions exist to help us adhere to that. Basically, whenever there‚Äôs
        something you are going to want to do multiple times in your code - you
        should make it a function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than repeating the code every single time you want to do that
        thing, you can just call the function as needed. And if you ever need to
        change how that functionality works, you now only need to do it in one
        place instead of everywhere you're doing that thing.
