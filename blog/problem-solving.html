      <h4>Simple Plan</h4>
      <p>
        While going through my work at Dev Academy, I came across a task to
        delete a particular piece of information from an object.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kind of like, deleting a phone number from your contacts list. Sounds
        easy right? They even told me to use the in built delete functionality
        in JavaScript!
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem was, I had never used this functionality before and wasn't
        exactly sure how to do it. So I googled "js object methods" and scrolled
        through the list on the MDN site (the bible of JS documentation). But
        there was no delete method listed there üò±
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="/images/deleteObject.png" />
        <figcaption>Delete where are youuuuu</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        My first clue should have been that they had specifically said delete
        "operator" and not method. So I refined my query and searched for "js
        object delete", and to my relief the second result was a guide on how to
        use the delete operator with objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know I could have just googled "how to delete a property from an
        object in js" or even asked AI, but I didn't just want to be told the
        answer, I wanted to learn how to do it myself by learning how the
        operator works.
      </p>

      <h4>Flip it & Reverse it</h4>
      <p>
        One task that I had some trouble with initially was taking some text and
        returning it in reverse, e.g. "word" should become "drow".
      </p>
      <p>
        I knew that strings (text) didn't have built in functionality to do
        something like this, but arrays did. So I wrote down the steps that I
        would need to do to complete this, using pseudocode to plan my approach.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="/images/pseudo.png" />
        <figcaption>Pseudocode in action</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        I then went through and implemented each of the steps, managing to do it
        all on one line, feeling pretty proud I hit the test button and... ‚ùå
        the test failed.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was sure I had done the right things, so I double checked and looked
        up each of the methods I was using to make sure that they did what I
        thought they did. Everything looked good, so why was it failing??
      </p>
      <p>
        My next step was to start logging values to the console, basically
        telling the program " show me what the word looks like at this point in
        the code". The solution I had written was all one line though, so I
        first had to break it down into multiple seperate steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started by logging the value after attempting to reverse my new array.
        It just showed me an array with a single value, which was the original
        word. Ok, so something is wrong earlier in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then logged the result of the very first step - splitting the string
        into an array. Sure enough, it spat out the same result as the previous
        log. So I knew something was wrong with this code, I read over it again
        and saw my mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
        Groaning as it was such a minor error - when you try to split up a
        string, you have to tell it where you want it to split it up e.g. at
        every space. I didn't include this information, and so by default it
        will just give you an array with the whole string as a single value.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was frustrating that I'd spent all of this time troubleshooting such
        a simple issue, but it was so satisfying to find the bug and fix it. I
        learnt a few things in this process; that I should pay more attention
        when reading my own code as the first step and that when logging values
        to the console, I should really just start from the top and not assume
        that what I've done earlier is working fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately though, I am really happy with how the solution turned out.
        Getting the functionality all on one line was satisfying and looks very
        clean.

      <h4>Mirror Mirror</h4>
      <p>
        After going through this sprint's Kata as well as last sprint's JS
        challenges, I feel pretty confident in using problem-solving techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have frequently been using pseudocode to start building a solution,
        talking it out to myself as I ago. When I encounter issues I'm able to
        read error messages or log values to the console to find where something
        is breaking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Searching for information online is something I do frequently both in my
        personal life and as part of the various jobs I've held in the past.
        Having grown up on the internet, my Google-fu is well honed.
      </p>

      <h4>üõü SOS üõü</h4>
      <p>
        If there is something I haven't been able to find the answer for, or
        have found conflicting answers - I've raised those for discussion in our
        stand ups for input from my peers & facilitator.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I encountered an issue getting started on this sprint's kata
        exercises, where when trying to run npm install in the repo I received
        an error.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know the help desk is there to support me with this kind of thing, but
        I did want to try and solve it on my own first. So I googled the error
        and tried some of the solutions I found, the one npm themselves
        recommend did not resolve the issue for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was able to eventually fix it, but I think next time I will just ask
        for help. I didn't really learn why the issue was occuring in the first
        place and probably could have fixed it and got on with my life quicker
        if I had just asked.
