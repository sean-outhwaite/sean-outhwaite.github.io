      <h4>Getting Meta</h4>
      <p>
        Before I start talking about bootcamp, I wanted to talk about this blog
        for a second. Over the last few weeks I've had a goal for myself of
        updating this site at least once per day - having at least one change
        published on Github every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've had the time to be able to make those changes pretty meaningful
        most of the time, but going forward I think I will have to accept that
        I'm not going to have the time to work on this as much as I'd like.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm still going to commit to making at least one change per day, but I
        think those changes are probably going to be pretty minor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hopefully I'll find some time to make bigger improvements occasionally
        (Bloggen definitely needs it as I was reminded when I lost the original
        draft of this blog post).
      </p>
      <h4>Whiplash</h4>
      <p>
        Although bootcamp only started 2 days ago, it definitely feels more
        intense already. Not due to the amount we're learning but more so the
        structure. During foundations I was able to work at my own pace, which
        usually meant finishing the weeks content in the first few days and
        being able to spend the remainder working on what I wanted to work on.
