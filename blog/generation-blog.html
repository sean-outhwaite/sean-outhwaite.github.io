      <h4>Laying the Foundations</h4>
      <p>
        One of the most tedious things I found about the foundations content at
        Dev Academy was creating all of the HTML for my blog posts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would spend time writing and editing my content until I was happy with
        it, then have to spend even more time chopping up that content and
        nicely wrapping each piece in the relevant HTML tags.
      </p>
      <h4>There has got to be a better way</h4>
      <p>
        Instead of spending a small amount of time doing this for each blog
        post, I decided to spend a large-ish amount of time building a solution
        for myself so that I would never have to do this again (although maybe I
        already never had to do this again as now I have finished foundations I
        have no obligation to continue to update this blog)
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to build something that would allow me to write my content just
        as I would in a text editor and then automatically give me that content
        in beautiful HTML structure.
      </p>
      <h4>Introducing... the Blog Generator</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="/images/bloggen.png" />
        <figcaption>What a beautiful UI</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        I built a page that had inputs for all (well most...) of the things I
        use on my blog posts and not only gives me the full HTML I need but also
        shows me a preview of what that content looks like.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the top content (the main and sub headings + date) can be edited
        and the preview + output will live update.
      </p>
      <p>
        Section headings and paragraphs will just continue to be appended as
        they're added.
      </p>
      <h4>Trials & Tribulations</h4>
      <p>
        My first version of the generator actually worked pretty well, but for
        all elements it would just append them to the bottom of the preview +
        output (from here on out I will refer to this as prevput).
      </p>
      <p>
        But this meant that you had to add the elements in the order they were
        going to appear on the page and that you could add multiples of some
        elements (e.g. main heading) where there should really only be one.
      </p>
      <p>
        So rather than just appending those things to the prevput, I decided to
        store them in an object. This allowed me to always place them in the
        correct location for my desired page structure and ensured that only one
        of each of those elements was included - as an added bonus it also meant
        that you could edit the content of those elements.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img class="exampleImage" src="/images/topgen.png" />
        <figcaption>The three Amigos</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        This also provided a solution for me to add the rest of my boilerplate
        HTML. I had only included what would go in the main section of the page
        in my HTML output, because I didn't want content to be placed in the
        wrong place.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I was now able to add the top and bottom of my HTML to the object
        and always output it in the correct order, so the final output can be
        pasted into a completely empty HTML file.
      </p>
      <h4>Dogfooding</h4>
      <p>
        As I began writing this blog using the generator, I noticed some
        annoying things.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had placed the output directly underneath the preview, with the input
        fields underneath that. This meant that as more content was added, the
        inputs got pushed further and further down the page and it was quite
        hard to distinguish where the preview ended and the output began.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make this better, I moved the output to the bottom as I don't really
        need to see the HTML as I'm writing the content. I also added a border
        to the preview so it's a bit more contained.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img class="exampleImage" src="/images/prevput.gif" />
        <figcaption>Hide the mess at the bottom</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        I initially was writing this blog on the local version of my project. As
        I was writing I thought ‚Äúhey, none of this is saved anywhere maybe I
        should at least manually make a copy so that I don‚Äôt lose it if
        something happens‚Äù. So I went and created a new html file in the repo to
        store my progress, and absentmindedly cmd-tabbed back to my browser to
        grab all the content.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I forgot, was that I have VS Code set to auto-save when it loses
        focus. When I switched to the browser it auto saved the changes (my
        shiny new html file) and triggered live-server to reload. This refreshed
        the page in my browser and wiped everything I had written üíÄ
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't started trying to solve this problem yet (I just switched to
        using the live version so I could still make changes to local if I want
        to), but I thought it was a good (albeit heartbreaking) example of going
        through the user experience and testing what you have built.
      </p>
      <h4>Final Thoughtsasy VII</h4>
      <p>
        I'm pretty happy with how the generator has turned out, there are a few
        improvements I want to make like being able to edit paragraph and
        section elements, make it easier to copy the final output, and save work
        in progress(haha).
      </p>
      <p>
        The output also isn't the prettiest, but I don't think I'll bother
        changing it as it gets tidied up once it's saved in VS Code anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        This whole post (except for any image elements...) was written using the
        generator! Once I finish writing this I will just copy the HTML below,
        paste it into my file and then lament the fact that I didn't think to do
        this sooner when I was writing multiple blog posts per week ü•≤
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, if you want to check it out yourself you can find the generator
