      <h4>Learning about me</h4>
      <p>
        Working through the human skills side of foundations has required a lot
        of introspection and along the way I've discovered a few things about
        myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iâ€™ve learnt that I do tend to have a growth mindset (without realising
        it), I am naturally curious about challenges and look for ways to
        overcome them rather than giving up.
      </p>
      <p>
        That I can be quite closed minded about things that donâ€™t necessarily
        interest me. Going through the human skills content has taught me be
        more open minded as I may find something more interesting than expected.
      </p>
      <p>
        That I need to be easier on myself. I'm often harder on myself than I
        would be with others, I need to give myself more slack and take pride in
        my progress.
      </p>
      <h4>Human Skills and Coding</h4>
      <p>
        For the most part, these things are the same no matter what job you are
        doing. You will always be interacting with or doing something for other
        people. Co-operating with others is an important part of being a human,
        and if you want to succeed (both as a human and professionally) you need
        to be able to understand and respond to your feelings and those of the
        people around you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Values specifically can play a huge role in programming. The things you
        build are defined by your values, do you want to build things that
        accessible for different kinds of people, do you want to build something
        malicious or insecure? Those decisions you make are important and will
        potentially impact thousands of people.
      </p>

      <h4>Surprise Surprise</h4>
      <p>
        At the beginning of foundations I was wary about spending so much time
        learning about these things and was more interested in focussing on the
        tech side. As Iâ€™ve gone through it I'm surprised at how Iâ€™ve found the
        human skills more interesting and have learnt more than I expected to.
      </p>

      <h4>Challenge-response</h4>
      <p>
        The hardest part of going through the human skills content has been the
        self reflection and writing about each facet. Writing the technical
        blogs comes very easily to me, as these things are usually pretty
        straightforward (x does y), but the human skills blogs are a bit more
        abstract and require a lot of thinking and introspection to produce the
        content (like this blog post!).
      </p>

      <h4>So why does Dev Academy focus so much on human skills?</h4>
      <p>
        Dev Academy doesnâ€™t want to just produce code robots (AI has that
        covered). Itâ€™s all well and good if youâ€™re a JavaScript master, but if
        youâ€™re unable to productively work with others youâ€™ll struggle to use
        those skills effectively in a team environment.
      </p>

      <h4>Was it a waste of time?</h4>
      <p>
        No, it doesnâ€™t feel like a waste of time. Iâ€™ve been working in tech for
        over 10 years and was still able to pick up some new things from the
        foundations content. Even if you werenâ€™t to continue working as a
        programmer, the skills and concepts weâ€™ve covered are just as applicable
        in any industry as well as in your personal life.
