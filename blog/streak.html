      <h2>RIP to my Github contribution streak</h2>
      <h3>22 Oct 2025</h3>
      <h4>It was fun while it lasted</h4>
      <p>
        As I've mentioned before on this site, when I started at Dev Academy I
        set myself a goal of creating and maintaining a contribution streak -
        effectively as a way to keep myself motivated and doing at least a
        little bit of coding every day.
      </p>
      <p>Well, I'm sad to announce that after 8 weeks, the streak has ended.</p>

          It's hard to see but there's a sad empty tile in the top right corner
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>New Beginnings</h4>
      <p>
        In the end the streak itself wasn't that important (after all, it can
        easily be gamed...). I have still been coding everyday since I made that
        commitment, it's just that unfortunately for me a lot of that work is
        hidden inside private repos that don't reflect in my contribution chart.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I'm going to try and start the streak anew, and continue what I've
        been doing which is learning and improving every day (even when I don't
        feel like it).
