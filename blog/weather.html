      <h4>AP Eyes</h4>
      <p>
        This week I've been learning about using APIs. I started with some basic
        ones, and progressed a bit to using an open API for weather data to
        display the local forecast for the next week.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can check out the project <a href="/weather.html">here</a>. It
        displays a rolling 7 day forecast for the weather in Auckland, including
        temperatures, precipitation, the max UV index, and an icon to indicate
        the weather.
      </p>

      <h4>Clear Skies</h4>
      <p>
        I don't really have much to say about the build process, it's a pretty
        simple project and it was quite straightforward to implement. Getting
        the icons and the weather description was a slightly harder, as the
        weather API only returns a numerical code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily I was able to find a JSON collection online of all off the codes
        with their text description as well as an image link, so I could just
        reference that with the code returned from the API.
      </p>
      <h4>On the Horizon</h4>
      <p>
        I'm not super happy with the UI for this project, but I don't really to
        come back and make any changes. I've moved onto working with React and
        Tailwind which I don't think Github pages works with. Perhaps if I run
        out of other projects I'll add some options like selecting a location or
        a date outside of the next 7 days.
