      <h4>This is the end.</h4>
      <p>
        After 17 intense weeks, my journey at Dev Academy has reached it's
        conclusion. As part of finishing up we worked on a final group project
        and presented it to friends and family.

      <h4>Hit the Road</h4>
      <p>
        Roadie is an AI powered roadtrip planning app. Once you've signed up,
        you can give it some information about where you're going and what
        you're interested in and Roadie will generate a route for you to take
        with some recommended stops along the way.
      </p>

        <img class="exampleImage" src="/images/roadieForm.png" />
        <figcaption>So clean</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        You can save your trips, and access them at any time if you're signed
        in.
      </p>
      <h4>Stacks</h4>
      <p>
        Roadie is a React app built in TypeScript, using Auth0 to handle sign
        up/authentication and a SQLite database to store user and roadtrip
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        It uses the Gemini API to find potential stops between your trip start
        and destination locations based on the interests you select. We then
        take that information and generate a route using the Google Maps APIs,
        display the path on a map, and populate some data from Google Places.
      </p>
      <p>The frontend styling was built with Tailwind &amp; Shadcn.</p>

      <h4>Reflections</h4>
      <p>
        I'm really proud of what we were able to build in just a few days. It
        looks and feels like a professional app, with some delightful animations
        and character.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alongside contributing to development, I was the Git Lead for this
        project and really enjoyed reviewing and merging everyone else's PRs. It
        was a good experience to see how other people solved problems, and
        thinking about the big picture/the impact of multiple peoples changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        We did some solid planning with creating tasks and drawing up
        wireframes, but I think we could have broken the tasks down a bit more.
        There were a few times where people were blocked because they were
        waiting on someone else to complete something.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall though I had a good time working on this, and I'm looking
        forward to getting to do this as an actual job!
