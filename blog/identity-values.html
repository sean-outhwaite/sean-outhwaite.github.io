      <h2>A little about me...</h2>
      <h3>03 September 2025</h3>

      <h4>My Background</h4>
      <p>
        My name is Sean, though most of my friends call me Swan (this started as
        a typo of my name but it stuck). After high school I wasn‚Äôt sure what I
        wanted to do, so instead of committing to study right away I started
        working in tech support for an ISP. Since then I have gone on to work
        various roles at companies such as Mighty Ape, Vend(now Lightspeed) and
        most recently I was a Product Manager at Fergus for four years.
      </p>

      <p>
        My parents are great role models, growing up they instilled in me strong
        values for things like basic manners and treating all people with
        respect. Throughout my life, making friends and working with people from
        all sorts of different backgrounds has taught me a lot about being more
        aware of my own privilege and considerate of other people.
      </p>

      <h4>Ethicical Decisions</h4>

      <p>
        I think almost every decision you make day to day has some ethical
        connotations but one big one for me was several years ago I decided to
        go vegan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I care about animal welfare I‚Äôm not opposed to eating
        meat/dairy as I think that‚Äôs a part of natural life, my main motivators
        were the environmental impact of the meat + dairy industry, and
        treatment of animals at these facilities. I read up about the impact
        these things have here in Aotearoa and how our waterways are polluted by
        the farming industry, I thought about my diet and the things I typically
        eat and how this change would affect me personally. I came to the
        conclusion that giving up these things wouldn‚Äôt be a huge challenge for
        me and that the pros would outweigh the cons.
      </p>

      <p>
        I kept that up for about 5 years but eventually returned to an omni
        diet. I found it difficult being a bit of a burden on those around me
        (having to pick spots with vegan options, providing vegan food at social
        gatherings, etc). I am still proud of the decision to try it and to have
        stuck with it for so long, and even today it still impacts the choices I
        make. I eat less meat than I used to, try to make sure it‚Äôs ethically
        sourced, and have switched exclusively to oat milk (honestly it‚Äôs just
        better).
      </p>

      <h4>My Strengths</h4>
      <p>
        Across my career I‚Äôve learned loads of different skills, from more
        technical things like IT skills and SQL, to soft skills like stakeholder
        management and communication (while I was at Vend I was even sent to a
        conference in Hong Kong to run workshops with one of our larger
        customers!).

          after this.

      <p>
        Having worked in Support for several years, I love problem solving.
        Coming across an issue, finding the root cause, and working towards a
        solution bring me a lot of satisfaction. I‚Äôve found even in my later
        career as a PM, the part I enjoyed the most was when bugs were reported
        in my area and I was able to spend time replicating & diagnosing these
        issues.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to the DOPE personality types, I'm a dove üïäÔ∏è (why is swan not
        one of the types??). Past coworkers have described me as a ‚Äúrock‚Äù for my
        team, that I stay calm and collected in tough situations and help to
        ground others when we encounter unexpected changes.
      </p>

        <figcaption>Some lovely feedback from a past colleague.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        Generally I‚Äôm a pretty quiet person, I used to get quite anxious about
        things like public speaking (I still do! But am better equipped to
        overcome it now). As I‚Äôve grown I‚Äôve tried to be more open minded about
        getting out of my comfort zone and challenging myself more (committing
        to dev academy was one of those challenges).
      </p>
      <p>
        Somewhat ironically though, I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôm an excellent
        communicator. As a PM I would frequently present to the whole company or
        directly to execs. Through practice and experience I‚Äôve learned how to
        convey my thoughts more clearly in written, verbal, & visual formats.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the best tips I‚Äôve picked up is to forget what I learned about
        writing in high school. There we were taught to start with an intro ->
        explanation -> conclusion. In reality most stakeholders want it the
        other way around, start with the most important point(s) you want people
        to takeaway and then dive into the supporting content.
      </p>
      <h4>My Limitations</h4>
      <p>
        I can easily get sucked down rabbit holes if I come across something
        that is interesting to me. Recently I was working with building a PDF
        form that had fields that could be filled programatically - essentially
        the customer would fill out a form via a bunch of input fields in our
        software and we would spit out a PDF with the info they entered. As I
        was building the PDF form I learnt that PDFs actually support some basic
        javascript and tried to create a form that would automatically calculate
        some of the information so that users didn‚Äôt need to manually enter it.
        I spent hours trying different scripts and troubleshooting why it wasn‚Äôt
        working, only to find out that it won‚Äôt execute unless it‚Äôs opened in
        specific software like Adobe Acrobat.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was time spent on something minor that wouldn‚Äôt have made that much
        of an impact that I could have spent on more productive things.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kind of related to the above, I also tend to be quite independent. I
        struggle to ask for help when I get stuck and want to find solutions on
        my own. Often this isn‚Äôt too harmful and just results in me spending a
        bit more time on something than necessary, but I know in this course I‚Äôm
        going to come across things that I can‚Äôt figure out on my own and will
        need to be mindful of time boxing myself and asking for help when I hit
        those walls.
      </p>

      <h4>Dealing with conflict</h4>

      <p>
        Being a Product Manager there were several times where while working
        with management on the direction of my team we disagreed about a
        particular solution or direction. I can‚Äôt share the specifics of what we
        were debating, but there was one case where they wanted to skip doing a
        piece of work so we could move onto other priorities but I felt that
        this work was important and we should not skip it.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this case I wrote a summary of why I believed we needed to do it and
        organised a meeting for me to run through my thinking and discuss
        possible outcomes. After the meeting I had managed to convince them that
        the work was necessary and our team was able to proceed. So it was kind
        of a happy ending, but how could I have handled this better?
      </p>

      <p>
        I think the sentiment of ‚ÄúShare early, share often‚Äù could have helped to
        prevent the disagreement from starting in the first place. If I had my
        thoughts and evidence prepared and visible earlier, the others would
        have had a better understanding of where I was coming from and why I
        felt strongly that it was important.
