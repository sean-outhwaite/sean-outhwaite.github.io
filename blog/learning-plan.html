      <h4>1. What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h4>
      <p>
        In the long term I would like to become a Principal or Staff engineer
        (long way away, I know!) for a small to medium size SaaS company. I
        definitely prefer IC roles over management positions, so am not super
        interested in pursuing a role in the team lead track. For the short term
        my goal will be to land a junior engineer position after completing
        bootcamp!
      </p>
      <h4>
        2. A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h4>
      <p>
        Strengths: Problem solving, ability to find information, calm demeanor
      </p>
      <p>
        Limitations: Have a strong desire to solve problems myself - making it
        difficult to ask for help, need time to think things through, can
        prioritise well but don't always work in priority order
      </p>
      <h4>
        3. What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see
        developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h4>
      <p>Being more open in asking for help.</p>
      <h4>
        4. A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      </h4>
      <p>
        This should include: * An explanation of how you will manage yourself to
        work productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
        industry/community representatives * What you will do when things are
        building up and starting to get to you
      </p>
      <h4>
        5. A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h4>
      <p>
        I'll start by timeboxing myself to find a solution on my own. Failing
        that I'll ask in the foundations-help=desk channel, and if that fails I
        will escalate to my facilitator.
      </p>
      <h4>6. A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
      <p>
        Feedback, it’s good to have an external perspective on where I could be
        improving. Support, if I’m struggling I expect facilitators to help me.
        Not to fix any problems for me but to work with me to find a solution.
        Respect.
      </p>
      <h4>
        7. Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
        committed to other things.
      </h4>
      <p>
        The only recurring outside commitment I have currently is on Mondays, I
        need to drop off & collect my dog from daycare between 7:30-8AM and
        around 3-4PM respectively.
