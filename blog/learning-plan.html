      <h2>My Learning Plan</h2>
      <h3>03 September 2025</h3>

      <h4>Career Aspirations</h4>
      <p>
        In the long term I would like to become a Principal or Staff engineer
        (long way away, I know!) for a small to medium size SaaS company. I
        prefer IC roles over management positions, so am not super interested in
        pursuing a role in the team lead track. For the short term my goal will
        be to land a junior engineer position after completing bootcamp!
      </p>
      <h4>Strengths & Limitations</h4>

      <h5>Strengths:</h5>
      <p>
        Problem solving - I really enjoy digging into problems and trying to
        resolve them. Especially when it comes to technical issues I've got a
        good sense of how to troubleshoot and resolve.<br />
        Ability to find information - Having grown up on the internet I know how
        to find and identify reliable information about a topic or problem.
        <br />
        Calm demeanor - I generally don't get frustrated or panic when something
        goes wrong, I expect this will happen a lot throughout my time at Dev
        Academy.
      </p>
      <h5>Limitations:</h5>
      <p>
        Strong desire to solve problems myself - This means I can find it
        difficult to ask for help, or sometimes spend too much time trying to
        figure something out on my own. <br />
        Need time to think things through - Not necessarily a bad thing, but I
        prefer to take time to think about things before making a decision,
        which can sometimes mean that others who are more decisive will make the
        decision first. <br />
        Don't always work in priority order - Although I'm pretty good at
        determining priority, I will sometimes choose to not start at the top
        and instead work on whatever is easier or more interesting for me.
      </p>
      <h4>Skills I want to develop while at Dev Academy?</h4>
      <p>
        Being more open in asking for help - I know that I'll learn more
        collaborating with others, so I want to work on asking for help rather
        than always trying to solve things on my own. I also want to develop my
        mentoring/leadership skills by helping others, so will be looking for
        opportunities to help peers when they are stuck <br />
        Forcing myself to do the hard work early and not leave it to the last
        minute - while I do get the work done, if it's something difficult or
        tedious I tend to procrastinate a bit which can create stress & anxiety.
        I want to build a habit of breaking things down into smaller tasks and
        tackling them instead.
      </p>
      <h4>My commitment to Dev Academy</h4>
      <p>
        During this programme I will be treating my learning like a full-time
        job. I will be dedicating 8 hours on weekdays and some additional time
        outside of those hours to revising and progressing my skillset.
      </p>
      <p>
        While working with others I will exercise kindness, empathy, and
        respect. Treating them the way I would like to be treated.<br />
        I understand that everyone learns at a different pace, thinks in
        different ways, and comes from a different background. I will be open to
        different perspectives and tolerant of others values.
      </p>
      <p>
        When things get tough, if possible I will take a break. Step away from
        my computer and take some time to clear my head. If necessary I will
        reach out to my facilitator for help.
      </p>
      <h4>How and where I will seek help</h4>
      <p>
        I'll start by timeboxing myself to find a solution on my own. <br />
        If I'm unable to do so in a reasonable timeframe, or if the problem is
        time sensitive I'll ask in the foundations-help-desk channel, with a
        thorough explanation of the issue and screenshots/code snippets if
        relevant. <br />
        If I'm unable to find a resolution there, then I will reach out to my
        facilitator directly.
      </p>
      <h4>What I expect from the Facilitation team</h4>
      <p>
        Feedback - it’s good to have an external perspective on where I could be
        improving.<br />
        Support - if I’m struggling I expect facilitators will be willing to
        help me. Not to fix any problems for me but to work with me to find a
        solution. <br />
        Respect - I expect that facilitators will treat me with respect as we
        work together.
      </p>
      <h4>External Commitments</h4>
      <p>
        The only recurring outside commitment I have currently is on Mondays, I
        need to drop off & collect my dog from daycare between 7:30-8AM and
        around 3-4PM respectively.
