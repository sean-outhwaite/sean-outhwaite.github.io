      <h4>What is "normal flow" anyway?</h4>
      <p>
        I know you came here to learn about how to position elements on a page
        using CSS, but before we get into that it's important to understand what
        we mean when we talk about <em>normal flow</em>. Simply put, Normal Flow
        is just the default way that elements are laid out on a page without any
        additional CSS styling. In practice that means that (in English at
        least...) block elements (e.g. paragraphs, divs) will start from the top
        and will be seperated onto new lines and that inline elements (e.g.
        spans) will display from left to right without being moved to a new
        line.
      </p>
      <h4>Static Shock</h4>
      <p>
        By default elements are given a position property of “static”, this
        means they will remain in their original position as per the normal flow
        and will not be affected by any changes to position properties such as
        “top”, “left”, etc.<br />
        Take a look at the example below. Notice that even when applying large
        changes to the top & left position properties the box stays in it's
        original position.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          id="staticExample"
          src="../images/static.png"
          alt="Example image of CSS static positioning"
        />
        <figcaption>
          Static elements don't move when position properties are changed.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>Getting to know your Relatives</h4>
      <p>
        Changing that property to “relative” means you can manipulate that
        elements placement relative to its original position. E.g. if you set
        the “left” property to 30px it will move 30px away from the left side of
        its original position. It’s important to note that with relative
        positioning, the element will stay inside the normal document flow i.e.
        it will not affect the positioning of other nearby elements. “the
        element remains in the normal flow of the document and the offset is
        applied relative to its original position”
      </p>
      <h4>Absolutely Amazing</h4>
      <p>
        Absolute: Changing the property to absolute will remove the element from
        the normal document flow and will allow you to change its position. This
        time the changes will not be relative to its original position (as it
        doesn’t have one!) but instead they will be relative to it’s closest
        parent element - not just it’s closest parent though, it will look for
        the closest ancestor with a property value other than static. This means
        it can work its way all the way up to the html or viewport elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fixed: Fixed positions are also removed from the normal document flow
        but are set relative to the viewport. So the element will always stay in
        the same place on-screen no matter where the page is scrolled. Fixed
        elements can be used for things like scroll bars or navigation where you
        want them to always remain in view.
      </p>
      <p>
        BONUS: Sticky: Sticky positions behave just like relative positions, but
        they do something special once a certain scroll point is reached - they
        toggle to a fixed position instead and will remain in that position to
        accompany you on your journey scrolling through the page.
