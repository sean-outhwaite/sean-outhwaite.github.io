      <h4>What is "normal flow" anyway?</h4>
      <p>
        I know you came here to learn about how to position elements on a page
        using CSS, but before we get into that it's important to understand what
        we mean when we talk about <em>normal flow</em>. Simply put, Normal Flow
        is just the default way that elements are laid out on a page without any
        additional CSS styling. In practice that means that (in English at
        least...) block elements (e.g. paragraphs, divs) will start from the top
        and will be seperated onto new lines and that inline elements (e.g.
        spans) will display from left to right without being moved to a new
        line.
      </p>
      <h4>Static Shock</h4>
      <p>
        By default elements are given a position property of ‚Äústatic‚Äù, this
        means they will remain in their original position as per the normal flow
        and will not be affected by any changes to position properties such as
        ‚Äútop‚Äù, ‚Äúleft‚Äù, etc.<br />
        Take a look at the example below. Notice that even when applying large
        changes to the top & left position properties the box stays in it's
        original position.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          id="staticExample"
          src="../images/static.png"
          alt="Example image of CSS static positioning"
        />
        <figcaption>
          Static elements don't move when positional properties are changed.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>Getting to know your Relatives</h4>
      <p>
        Setting the position property to ‚Äúrelative‚Äù means you can manipulate
        that element's placement <span>relative</span> to its original position.
        E.g. if you set the ‚Äúleft‚Äù property to 30px it will move 30px away from
        the left side of its original position. <br />It‚Äôs important to note
        that with relative positioning, any gaps created by changes made to an 
        element's position will not be filled by other content - i.e. blocks will 
        still be separate lines and won't overlap. <br />
        Notice in the example below that our new box has been moved away from
        it's original positions on the top and left sides but it still remains
        in the document flow underneath our original box.
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="../images/relative.png"
          alt="Example image of CSS static positioning"
        />
        <figcaption>
          Relative elements can be moved relative to their original
          position.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>Absolutely Amazing</h4>
      <p>
        Changing the position property to absolute will remove the element from
        the normal document flow and allow you to change its position.
        <br />This time the changes will not be relative to its original
        position (as it doesn‚Äôt have one!) but instead they will be relative to
        it‚Äôs closest parent element - not just it‚Äôs closest parent though,
        <span
          >it will look for the closest ancestor with a property value other
          than static</span
        >. <br />This is important to remember as it means it can work its way
        all the way up to the html or viewport elements if none of its other
        parents have their position property set to something other than static.
      </p>
      <p>
        See absolute in action below. Now that our box has been removed from the
        normal flow, it appears on top of our original box and is moved relative
        to it's parent's position (in this example, an invisible div).
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img
          src="../images/absolute.png"
          alt="Example image of CSS static positioning"
        />
        <figcaption>
          Absolute elements are removed from the normal flow and positioned
          relative to their closest parent.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <h4>Fixed It</h4>
      <p>
        Fixed positions are also removed from the normal document flow but are
        set relative to the viewport. So the element will always stay in the
        same place on-screen no matter where the page is scrolled. Fixed
        elements can be used for things like scroll bars or navigation where you
        want them to always remain in view.
      </p>

      <p>
        Normally this is where I would include an example of an element with <span>positon: fixed;</span>, 
        however there's been one in front of you all along. Take a look at the bottom right corner of your 
        screen and try highlighting it to find the hidden message.
      </p>
      <div id="fixDiv">Have a nice day!</div>
      </figure>
      <h4>Bonus Round: Let's get sticky</h4>
      <p>
        Sticky positions will initially behave just like relative positions, but
        they do something special once a certain scroll point is reached - they
        toggle to a fixed position instead and will remain in that position to
        accompany you on your journey scrolling through the page.
      </p>

        <img
          src="../images/sticky.gif"
          alt="Example image of CSS static positioning"
        />
        <figcaption>
          Sticky Elements will start with a relative position but become fixed once a certain scrollpoint is reached.
