      <h2>I've heard of microplastics, but what are neuroplastics?</h2>
      <h3>15 September 2025</h3>

      <h4>Fake Plastic Brains</h4>
      <p>
        An information hazard is a piece of information that just by knowing it, could cause harm to you.
      </p>
      <p>
         Neuroplasticity is the opposite of that. By being aware of the concept and principles of neuroplasticity, 
         you can use that information to learn more effectively and even subconsciously become more open-minded about 
         your ability to learn.
      </p>
      <p>Studies have shown that just by understanding that your brain has the physical capacity to adapt and improve, 
        you can improve your motivation to learn.
      </p>

      <h4>Neuroplasticity in Action</h4>
      <p>
        On reflection, I‚Äôve already been incorporating some of the principles of neuroplasticity into my study
       - by practicing coding everyday (even on weekends!) I‚Äôm strengthening the neuron pathways associated
        with those skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Repeating and revising the things I‚Äôve learned over the previous weeks helps to prevent those existing
        pathways from being ‚Äúpruned‚Äù and keeps that knowledge more accessible for my brain to build new
       connections to as I continue my study.
      </p>

      <p>Something I would like to try and practice more is applying my learning to something more meaningful
       to me - by applying that learning to something important to me I can improve my chances of success
        in understanding and retaining that information.</p>
      <h4>How to Get Good</h4>
      <p>
        A lot of it comes down to just general health advice (so you should do these things even if you‚Äôre not
        specifically trying to increase your neuroplasticity) like eating a healthy diet, regular physical
       exercise, and maintaining a good sleep schedule (something I struggle with).
      </p>
      <p>If you‚Äôre already doing all of that, good job you‚Äôre off to a great start!</p>
      <p>
     You‚Äôre not done yet though, if you want to maximise your neuroplasticity you should also consider
      trying some of the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Learn something new! Pick up an instrument, try a new language.</li>
          <li>Socialisation for neuroplastication - I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs actually a word, but yes, go out and talk to people, go to a concert, do whatever it is you like doing outside of your house with other people.</li>
          <li>Take a vacation - Yes really. Go somewhere new and experience a different place.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h4>Growth Mindsetting</h4>
      <p>
        Growth mindset is the recognition that you have the capacity to learn and grow, in comparison a fixed 
        mindset is one that believes that your ability or intelligence is pre-determined and cannot be changed.
      </p>
      <p>Having a growth mindset is important when learning, especially when confronted with obstacles or 
      difficulties. Rather than perceiving those experiences negatively and believing that they‚Äôre 
      insurmountable, a growth mindset allows you to reflect and learn from them, leveraging the principles 
      of neuroplasticity you can adapt and improve your chances of overcoming them.
      </p>
      <h4>Growing Up</h4>
      <p>
        In doing this research, I was quite surprised by the amount of studies and data that backs these theories up. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When you‚Äôre young you always hear things like ‚Äúyou can do anything you put your mind to‚Äù, and they sound so 
        hyperbolic that they‚Äôre almost unbelievable. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It was refreshing to see evidence that this kind of statement is pretty much true, and that there
        are practical ways you can approach learning to make them a reality.
      </p>
      <h4>Personal Growth</h4>
      <p>
        When I find something difficult I tend to be quite critical about myself and my own ability. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Going forward I will actively try to be more positive when I encounter something I have trouble understanding,
         and give myself more credit for the effort and attempt to understand it.
      </p>
      <p>
         I really like the ‚Äúnot yet‚Äù attitude Carol Dweck talks about in <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve">her TED presentation</a> and hope to adopt this kind of mindset.
      </p>
      <h4>Want to know more?</h4>
      <p>
        A lot of blogs/articles online tend to just regurgitate the same points, and I couldn‚Äôt find 
        any that at least did it in an engaging or fun format. I actually found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/14jkxho/method_adults_that_have_actually_developed_a/">this reddit thread</a>
        to be a great resource, it‚Äôs real people discussing their personal experiences with developing
        a growth mindset.
      </p>
      <p>This paragraph in particular really got me thinking about how we perceive our own failures:</p>
      <p class="quote">‚ÄúChildren suck at everything and fail at everything, but they try, they fail, they get back up & try again, and they learn some incredibly difficult things, like languages, without really thinking of it as growth or learning. To them it's all "play." At some point as adults "failure" becomes stigmatized, "play" becomes competitive, and we're suddenly afraid to fail, afraid to "lose," we imagine others are watching and laughing at our failures.‚Äù</p>
