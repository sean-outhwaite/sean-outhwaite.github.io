      <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h2>
      <h3>08 September 2025</h3>

      <h4>What is emotional intelligence</h4>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence refers to all of the "soft" skills that are used
        to navigate the social and emotional situations that we all face
        everyday.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being emotionally intelligent means being able to effectively
        understand, manage, & express your emotions through practicing self
        awareness and empathy for others.
      </p>
      <h4>How is EQ different to IQ</h4>
      IQ is the system we use to measure cognitive ability. It is a measure of
      how well someone can apply things like logic or memory, to process new information or problem solve.
    </p>
    <p>
      EQ on the other hand is the measurement system for someones emotional intelligence. Thinks of it as an indicator
       for a person's ability to understand and regulate their own emotional state, as well as how they understand 
       and respond to others.
    </p>
      <h4>Why is EQ important</h4>
    <p>
      We experience difficult emotions and stressful situations every day, having a high EQ means being able
       to understand those emotions, remain calm, and learn from them - giving you the tools to better respond to hardship.
    </p>

    <p>
      Practicing emotional intelligence not only helps ourselves, but it also helps others. It can foster 
      better understanding and interactions between people in all aspects of life - from helping you communicate 
      with your family to dealing with conflict in the workplace.
